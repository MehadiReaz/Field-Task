# 🔔 Quick Start - Expired Tasks Notification

## ✅ What Was Done

Added a simple notification system that alerts users about overdue tasks when they open the app.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Push Notifications** - Shows alert when expired tasks are found
2. **Visual Badge** - Red badge in task list showing expired count  
3. **Auto-Check** - Runs automatically on app launch
4. **Free Tier Compatible** - Works with Firebase free plan

## 📱 How It Works

```
App Launch → 2 sec delay → Check expired tasks → Show notification (if any)
```

## 🎨 What Users See

**Notification:**
```
⚠️ 3 Tasks Overdue
You have 3 tasks that are past their due dates
```

**Badge in AppBar:**
```
My Tasks              [⚠️ 3]  ← Click to filter
```

## 📦 What Was Added

- ✅ `flutter_local_notifications` package
- ✅ `LocalNotificationService` - Handles notifications
- ✅ `ExpiredTasksCheckerService` - Checks for expired tasks
- ✅ Badge in task list AppBar
- ✅ Auto-check on app launch

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Create an expired task:**
   - Create a task with due date in the past
   - Close the app completely

2. **Reopen the app:**
   - Wait 2 seconds after launch
   - You should see a notification
   - Check the task list for red badge

3. **Tap the badge:**
   - Should filter to show expired tasks

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Turn Off Notifications
Comment these lines in `lib/main.dart`:
```dart
// await notificationService.initialize();
// Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2), () {
//   expiredTasksChecker.checkAndNotifyExpiredTasks();
// });
```

### Change Delay Time
In `lib/main.dart`, change:
```dart
Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2), () {  // Change here
```
