# ✅ Index Building in Progress!

## Good News! 🎉

The error message has **changed** - this is progress!

### Before (Bad):
```
The query requires an index. You can create it here...
```

### Now (Good):
```
That index is currently building and cannot be used yet.
```

## What This Means

✅ Indexes were **successfully created**
✅ Firestore is **currently building** them
⏳ You need to **wait 2-10 minutes** for completion

## What to Do

### Option 1: Wait (Recommended)
Just wait 2-10 minutes. The indexes will be ready soon!

**Check status:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tasktrackr-f106e/firestore/indexes

Look for:
- 🟡 **Building** → Wait a bit more
- 🟢 **Enabled** → Ready! Restart your app and test

### Option 2: Monitor Progress
Keep testing the filters every minute. Once the indexes are built:
- ✅ No more errors
- ✅ Filters work perfectly
- ✅ Fast query performance

## Timeline

Based on your database size:
- **Small database** (< 100 tasks): 2-3 minutes
- **Medium database** (100-1000 tasks): 3-5 minutes
- **Large database** (> 1000 tasks): 5-10 minutes

## What's Being Built

These composite indexes:
1. `assignedTo` + `status` + `dueDate` (Ascending)
2. `assignedTo` + `status` + `dueDate` (Descending)

Used by filters:
- ✅ Pending filter
- ✅ Checked In filter
- ✅ Completed filter
- ✅ Expired filter

## After Indexes Are Built

1. **Restart your Flutter app**
2. **Test all filters** - they should work perfectly!
3. **No more errors** in logcat

## Current Status

⏳ **BUILDING** - Indexes are being created right now
📊 **Progress:** Check Firebase Console for real-time status
⏰ **ETA:** 2-10 minutes

**Just wait a few minutes and try again! The hard part is done - the indexes are building!** 🎉
