# Troubleshooting: Area Selection Dialog Not Showing

## Issue
After login, the console shows "‚ö†Ô∏è User has no selected area" but the area selection dialog doesn't appear.

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

1. **Added debug logging** in both `splash_page.dart` and `login_page.dart` to track:
   - When user is authenticated
   - Whether user has selectedAreaId
   - When dialog should show
   - Dialog result

2. **Added delay before showing dialog** (300ms) to ensure widget tree is built

3. **Added mounted checks** to prevent showing dialog on unmounted widgets

4. **Added imports** to login_page.dart for AreaBloc and AreaSelectionDialog

## How to Test

### 1. Clear existing user data (to simulate first login):
```dart
// In terminal or code
await secureStorage.deleteAll();
```

### 2. Run the app and login:
```bash
flutter run
```

### 3. Watch the console logs:
You should see logs like:
```
üîç Login: User authenticated. SelectedAreaId: null
‚ö†Ô∏è Login: No area selected, showing dialog
üì± Login: Showing area selection dialog
```

### 4. Expected behavior:
- Area selection dialog appears
- User must select an area
- Cannot dismiss without selecting
- After selection, navigates to home

## Debug Logs to Look For

### When login succeeds with no area:
```
üîç Login: User authenticated. SelectedAreaId: null
‚ö†Ô∏è Login: No area selected, showing dialog
üì± Login: Showing area selection dialog
‚úÖ Login: Dialog result: true
‚úÖ Login: Area selected, refreshing user and navigating to home
```

### When login succeeds with area already selected:
```
üîç Login: User authenticated. SelectedAreaId: area123
‚úÖ Login: User has area, navigating to home
```

### From splash page (on app restart):
```
üîç Splash: User authenticated. SelectedAreaId: null
‚ö†Ô∏è Splash: No area selected, showing dialog
üì± Splash: Showing area selection dialog
```

## If Dialog Still Doesn't Show

### Check 1: User has selectedAreaId in Firestore
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore Database
3. Open users collection
4. Check your user document
5. Look for `selectedAreaId` field
6. If it exists and is not null, delete it to test

### Check 2: Areas exist in database
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Check if `areas` collection has documents
3. If empty, create at least one area first

### Check 3: Dialog widget is properly created
The dialog should have:
- AreaBloc provider
- LoadAreasEvent triggered on init
- isRequired = true (cannot dismiss)

### Check 4: Check context
Make sure `mounted` is true before showing dialog:
```dart
if (!mounted) return;
await showDialog(...);
```

## Manual Test Steps

1. **Fresh install test**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Login with Google/Email**

3. **Expected**: Area selection dialog should appear

4. **Select an area**

5. **Expected**: Navigate to home page

6. **Logout** (from profile page)

7. **Login again**

8. **Expected**: Should go directly to home (area already selected)

## Additional Debug Code

Add this to area_selection_dialog.dart initState:
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  print('üé® AreaSelectionDialog: Widget created');
  context.read<AreaBloc>().add(const LoadAreasEvent());
}
```

Add this to area_bloc.dart LoadAreasEvent handler:
```dart
Future<void> _onLoadAreas(...) async {
  print('üìã AreaBloc: Loading areas...');
  emit(const AreaLoading());
  
  final result = await getAreas(NoParams());
  
  result.fold(
    (failure) {
      print('‚ùå AreaBloc: Error loading areas: ${failure.message}');
      emit(AreaError(failure.message));
    },
    (areas) {
      print('‚úÖ AreaBloc: Loaded ${areas.length} areas');
      emit(AreasLoaded(areas));
    },
  );
}
```

## Quick Fix Commands

### Reset user's area in Firebase Console (Firestore):
```javascript
// Navigate to user document
db.collection('users').doc('USER_ID_HERE').update({
  selectedAreaId: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.delete()
});
```

### Reset local storage (in app):
```dart
// Add this as a button in settings page
await getIt<FlutterSecureStorage>().deleteAll();
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Console shows dialog creation logs
‚úÖ Dialog appears on screen
‚úÖ Areas list is loaded
‚úÖ User can select an area
‚úÖ After selection, navigates to home
‚úÖ selectedAreaId is saved in Firestore
‚úÖ On next login, goes directly to home

## Still Not Working?

Check these files have the correct imports:
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/login_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/splash_page.dart`

Required imports:
```dart
import '../../../../injection_container.dart';
import '../../../areas/presentation/bloc/area_bloc.dart';
import '../widgets/area_selection_dialog.dart';
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- [ ] Clear app data or reinstall
- [ ] Check Firebase Console - areas collection has documents
- [ ] Check Firebase Console - user document has no selectedAreaId
- [ ] Login and watch console logs
- [ ] Dialog appears
- [ ] Select area
- [ ] Navigate to home
- [ ] Check Firestore - user now has selectedAreaId
