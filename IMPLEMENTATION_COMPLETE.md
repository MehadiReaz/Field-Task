### Problem 7: Firestore security rules

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Login Flow
1. User logs in (Google or Email)
2. Auth token and user data are saved
3. If user has no `selectedAreaId`:
   - Area selection dialog appears (required - cannot dismiss)
   - User selects an area
   - `selectedAreaId` is saved to Firestore and local cache
4. User proceeds to home page

### Task Creation Flow
1. User taps "Create Task"
2. Fills in task details
3. Task is created with `areaId` = user's `selectedAreaId`
4. Task is saved to Firestore (rules validate areaId matches user's area)

### Task Display Flow
1. App fetches tasks from Firestore
2. Query filters by:
   - `assignedTo` = current user OR `createdBy` = current user
   - AND `areaId` = user's `selectedAreaId`
3. Only tasks from user's selected area are shown

### Change Area Flow
1. User goes to Profile page
2. Taps "Change" button in Work Area section
3. Area selection dialog appears (optional - can dismiss)
4. User selects new area
5. `selectedAreaId` is updated in Firestore
6. Task list automatically refreshes to show tasks from new area

## 🔒 Security

Firestore rules ensure:
- Users can only create tasks in their selected area
- Users can only view tasks from their selected area
- Users can only update/delete tasks from their selected area
- Area changes are properly reflected in real-time

## 📱 User Experience

### Improvements Made:
1. **Smooth Login**: Auth token properly saved, no need to re-login
2. **Proper Logout**: Confirmation dialog + proper data cleanup
3. **Area Management**: Easy area selection and changing
4. **Area-Based Tasks**: Tasks filtered by area automatically
5. **Real-time Updates**: Task list updates when area changes
6. **Security**: Users can only access tasks from their area

### UI Features:
- ✅ Area selection dialog with loading/error/empty states
- ✅ Required area selection on first login
- ✅ Change area button in profile
- ✅ Logout confirmation dialog
- ✅ Auto-filter tasks by selected area

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Complete These Tests:

1. **Login & Logout**
   - [ ] Login with Google
   - [ ] Login with Email
   - [ ] Verify auth token is saved
   - [ ] Logout and verify redirect to login
   - [ ] Verify data is cleared after logout

2. **Area Selection**
   - [ ] First login - verify area selection dialog (required)
   - [ ] Select an area and verify you can proceed
   - [ ] Go to Profile and change area
   - [ ] Verify task list updates after changing area

3. **Task Management**
   - [ ] Create a task - verify areaId is set
   - [ ] View tasks - verify only tasks from selected area are shown
   - [ ] Change area - verify different tasks appear
   - [ ] Try to create task without area selected (should fail gracefully)

4. **Multiple Users**
   - [ ] Login as User A in Area 1, create tasks
   - [ ] Login as User B in Area 2, create tasks
   - [ ] Verify User A only sees Area 1 tasks
   - [ ] Verify User B only sees Area 2 tasks
