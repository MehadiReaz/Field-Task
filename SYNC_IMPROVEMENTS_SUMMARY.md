## Before vs After

### Syncing State
**Before:** "Syncing... â€¢ Syncing 4 items"
**After:** "Syncing 75% â€¢ 3 of 4 items" + progress bar

### Success State
**Before:** "Synced â€¢ 3 items at 14:32"
**After:** "Synced Successfully â€¢ 3 items â€¢ 14:32" + haptic feedback + bounce animation

### Error State
**Before:** "Sync Failed â€¢ [error message]"
**After:** "Sync Failed â€¢ 2 items failed" + stronger haptic + conditional retry button

### Pending State
**Before:** "3 items pending â€¢ Last sync: 14:30"
**After:** "3 Items Pending â€¢ Last sync: 14:30" + rotating sync icon + better button

## Technical Improvements
