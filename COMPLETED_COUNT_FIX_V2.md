# ✅ Dashboard & Expiry System - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** 🎉 FULLY IMPLEMENTED & READY TO USE

---

## 📝 What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Dashboard Collection in Firebase
A `dashboard` collection that tracks task counts by status for each user in real-time.

**Document Structure:**
```json
/dashboard/{userId}
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "total": 15,
  "pending": 5,
  "checkedIn": 3,
  "completed": 4,
  "expired": 2,
  "cancelled": 1,
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### ✅ 2. Automatic Count Updates
Counts update automatically on every task operation:

| Operation | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Create Task** | `total +1`, `pending +1` (or status) |
| **Complete Task** | `pending -1`, `completed +1` |
| **Delete Task** | `total -1`, `status -1` |
| **Check-In Task** | `pending -1`, `checkedIn +1` |
| **Task Expires** | `pending -1`, `expired +1` |

### ✅ 3. Automatic Expiry Detection
Tasks are checked on **every load** to see if they've passed their due date.

**When Task Expires:**
- Adds `metadata.isExpired: true` to task document
- Adds `metadata.expiredAt: timestamp`
- Updates dashboard counts (moves from status to expired)
- **Status preserved** - task keeps original status but flagged as expired

**Expiry Checks Run On:**
- `getTasks()` - Full task list load
- `getTasksPage()` - Paginated load  
- `getTaskById()` - Individual task load
- Dashboard initialization on login

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. Task Remote DataSource
**File:** `lib/features/tasks/data/datasources/task_remote_datasource.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added `DashboardService` and `TaskExpiryService` dependencies
- Updated `getTasks()` - Check expiry before fetch
- Updated `getTasksPage()` - Check expiry before fetch
- Updated `getTaskById()` - Check expiry for single task
- Updated `createTask()` - Increment dashboard counts
- Updated `updateTask()` - Update counts on status change
- Updated `deleteTask()` - Decrement dashboard counts
- Updated `checkInTask()` - Update counts (pending → checked in)
- Updated `completeTask()` - Update counts (status → completed)

### 2. Auth Bloc
**File:** `lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added `DashboardService` dependency
- Initialize dashboard on successful login
- Recalculate all counts on login

### 3. Firestore Rules
**File:** `firestore.rules`

**Changes:**
- Added rules for `dashboard` collection
- Users can read/write their own dashboard

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 2: Login to App
The dashboard will automatically initialize when you login!

```dart
// This is already done in AuthBloc
// On successful login:
await dashboardService.initializeDashboard();
await dashboardService.recalculateAllCounts();
```

### Step 3: Use in Your App
The system works automatically! But you can also:

**Get Counts:**
```dart
final counts = await dashboardService.getDashboard();
print('Pending: ${counts['pending']}');
print('Completed: ${counts['completed']}');
print('Expired: ${counts['expired']}');
```

**Watch Counts (Real-time):**
```dart
StreamBuilder<Map<String, int>>(
  stream: dashboardService.watchDashboard(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final counts = snapshot.data ?? {};
    return Text('Pending: ${counts['pending']}');
  },
)
```

**Force Expiry Check:**
```dart
await taskExpiryService.checkAndUpdateExpiredTasks();
```

## 🎯 Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Create a Task
```
User creates pending task
↓
Task saved to Firestore
↓
Dashboard updated:
  - total: 10 → 11
  - pending: 5 → 6
```

### Example 2: Complete a Task
```
User completes pending task
↓
Task status: pending → completed
↓
Dashboard updated:
  - total: 11 (unchanged)
  - pending: 6 → 5
  - completed: 3 → 4
```

### Example 3: Task Expires
```
Task has dueDate: 2025-10-20
Current date: 2025-10-21
↓
User opens app (getTasks() called)
↓
Expiry check runs automatically
↓
Task updated:
  - status: pending (unchanged)
  - metadata.isExpired: true
  - metadata.expiredAt: 2025-10-21T10:00:00Z
↓
Dashboard updated:
  - total: 11 (unchanged)
  - pending: 5 → 4
  - expired: 2 → 3
```

### Example 4: Delete a Task
```
User deletes completed task
↓
Task deleted from Firestore
↓
Dashboard updated:
  - total: 11 → 10
  - completed: 4 → 3
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests:

- [x] **Create task** → Dashboard total +1, status +1
- [x] **Update task status** → Dashboard counts adjust correctly
- [x] **Complete task** → Old status -1, completed +1
- [x] **Delete task** → Dashboard total -1, status -1
- [x] **Check-in task** → pending -1, checkedIn +1
- [x] **Task expires** → status -1, expired +1
- [x] **Login** → Dashboard initialized automatically
- [x] **View counts** → Real-time updates work

### Firebase Console Verification:

1. Login to app
2. Create some tasks
3. Open Firebase Console → Firestore
4. Check `dashboard` collection
5. Verify counts are correct
6. Complete a task in app
7. Refresh Firestore → counts updated instantly

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Counts show 0
**Fix:** 
```dart
await dashboardService.recalculateAllCounts();
```

### Issue: Expired tasks not detected
**Check:**
1. Task has `dueDate` field
2. Task status is `pending` or `checked_in`
3. Due date is in past
4. Called `getTasks()` to trigger check

**Manual trigger:**
```dart
await taskExpiryService.checkAndUpdateExpiredTasks();
```

### Issue: Dashboard not updating
**Check:**
1. Firestore rules deployed
2. User authenticated
3. No errors in console
4. Dashboard collection exists

**Force refresh:**
```dart
await dashboardService.recalculateAllCounts();
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Dashboard in Firebase:
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database
3. Navigate to `dashboard` collection
4. Find your user ID
5. See real-time counts

### View Expired Tasks:
Firestore query:
```
Collection: tasks
Filter: metadata.isExpired == true
```

### Check Logs:
All operations logged with `AppLogger`:
```
[INFO] Dashboard initialized for user: abc123
[INFO] Updated counts: pending → completed
[WARNING] Marked task as expired: task123 (was pending)
```
