# âœ… Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

- [x] Dashboard service created
- [x] Task expiry service created
- [x] Remote datasource integrated
- [x] Auth bloc updated
- [x] Firestore rules updated
- [x] Build runner executed successfully
- [x] No compilation errors

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
**Expected:** Rules deployed successfully, dashboard collection accessible

### 2. Test Login
- [ ] Login to app
- [ ] Check console logs for "Dashboard initialized"
- [ ] Open Firebase Console â†’ Firestore
- [ ] Verify `dashboard/{userId}` document created
- [ ] All counts should be 0 (or calculated from existing tasks)

### 3. Test Create Task
- [ ] Create a new task (status: pending)
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Verify: `total` increased by 1
- [ ] Verify: `pending` increased by 1

### 4. Test Complete Task
- [ ] Complete a pending task
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Verify: `total` stays same
- [ ] Verify: `pending` decreased by 1
- [ ] Verify: `completed` increased by 1

### 5. Test Check-In
- [ ] Check-in to a pending task
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Verify: `pending` decreased by 1
- [ ] Verify: `checkedIn` increased by 1

### 6. Test Delete Task
- [ ] Delete a task
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Verify: `total` decreased by 1
- [ ] Verify: Appropriate status count decreased by 1

### 7. Test Expiry Detection
- [ ] Create a task with past due date (e.g., yesterday)
- [ ] Close and reopen app (or pull to refresh)
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ `tasks/{taskId}`
- [ ] Verify: `metadata.isExpired` = true
- [ ] Verify: `metadata.expiredAt` has timestamp
- [ ] Check `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Verify: Status count decreased by 1
- [ ] Verify: `expired` increased by 1

### 8. Test Real-Time Updates
- [ ] Open Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ `dashboard/{userId}`
- [ ] Keep it open
- [ ] Create/update/delete tasks in app
- [ ] Verify: Counts update in real-time in Firebase Console

## Verification

### Check Logs
Look for these messages in console:
```
[INFO] Dashboard initialized for user: {userId}
[INFO] Dashboard recalculated: total=X, pending=Y, ...
[INFO] Updated counts: pending â†’ completed
[WARNING] Marked task as expired: {taskId} (was pending)
```

### Check Firestore Structure
```
/dashboard
  /{userId}
    - userId: string
    - total: number
    - pending: number
    - checkedIn: number
    - completed: number
    - expired: number
    - cancelled: number
    - lastUpdated: timestamp

/tasks
  /{taskId}
    - status: string
    - dueDate: string
    - metadata: map
      - isExpired: boolean (optional)
      - expiredAt: string (optional)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard not created
**Solution:**
```dart
// Run manually in code
await getIt<DashboardService>().initializeDashboard();
await getIt<DashboardService>().recalculateAllCounts();
```

### Issue: Counts incorrect
**Solution:**
```dart
// Force recalculation
await getIt<DashboardService>().recalculateAllCounts();
```

### Issue: Expiry not working
**Check:**
- [ ] Task has `dueDate` field (not null)
- [ ] Due date is in the past
- [ ] Task status is `pending` or `checked_in`
- [ ] `getTasks()` or `getTasksPage()` was called

**Manual trigger:**
```dart
await getIt<TaskExpiryService>().checkAndUpdateExpiredTasks();
```

### Issue: Permission denied
**Check:**
- [ ] Firestore rules deployed
- [ ] User is authenticated
- [ ] User is accessing their own dashboard document

## Success Criteria

âœ… Dashboard document created on login  
âœ… Counts update on task creation  
âœ… Counts update on status change  
âœ… Counts update on deletion  
âœ… Expired tasks detected automatically  
âœ… Expired tasks flagged in metadata  
âœ… Dashboard counts include expired count  
âœ… Real-time updates work  
âœ… No errors in console  

## Performance Check

- [ ] Dashboard operations don't block UI
- [ ] Expiry check completes in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Task operations complete in < 1 second
- [ ] No noticeable lag when creating/updating tasks

## Final Verification

```bash
# Check for errors
flutter analyze

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### Test Flow:
1. Login â†’ Dashboard initialized âœ…
2. Create 3 pending tasks â†’ total=3, pending=3 âœ…
3. Complete 1 task â†’ total=3, pending=2, completed=1 âœ…
4. Check-in to 1 task â†’ pending=1, checkedIn=1, completed=1 âœ…
5. Delete completed task â†’ total=2, checkedIn=1, pending=1 âœ…
6. Create expired task â†’ After reload: total=3, expired=1 âœ…
