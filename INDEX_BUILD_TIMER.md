# Index Build Timer ⏰

## Build Started: 7:56 PM (October 19, 2025)

## Expected Completion Times:

| Database Size | Expected Ready Time | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Small (< 100 tasks) | **7:59 PM** | 3 minutes |
| Medium (100-1000 tasks) | **8:01 PM** | 5 minutes |
| Large (> 1000 tasks) | **8:06 PM** | 10 minutes |

## Check Status Every Minute

### At 7:59 PM (3 min):
```bash
# Try the filters in your app
# Check Firebase Console
```

### At 8:01 PM (5 min):
```bash
# Try the filters again
# Most databases should be ready by now
```

### At 8:06 PM (10 min):
```bash
# All indexes should definitely be ready
# If still not working, something else is wrong
```

## Quick Test Command

Run your app and try filtering:
```bash
flutter run
# Then tap Filter → Pending
```

## Firebase Console Link

Check index status:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tasktrackr-f106e/firestore/indexes

## What Success Looks Like

✅ **In Firebase Console:**
- All indexes show "Enabled" (green)
- No "Building" status

✅ **In Your App:**
- Filters work without errors
- Tasks load quickly
- No FAILED_PRECONDITION in logcat

✅ **In Logcat:**
```
No more error messages!
```

## If Still Not Working After 10 Minutes

1. Refresh Firebase Console
2. Check for error messages in Console
3. Try deploying again:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```
4. Check if you're logged into correct Firebase account
