# Firestore Index Fix - Action Items ✅

## What Was Done

### ✅ Problem Identified
Firestore queries were failing with `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error because composite indexes were missing for filter queries.

### ✅ Indexes Added
Added two composite indexes to `firestore.indexes.json`:

1. **Index for Ascending Order**
   - Fields: `assignedTo` → `status` → `dueDate` (ASC)
   - Used by: Filter queries with ascending date order

2. **Index for Descending Order**
   - Fields: `assignedTo` → `status` → `dueDate` (DESC)
   - Used by: Filter queries with descending date order

### ✅ Indexes Deployed
Successfully deployed to Firebase using:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Index Building (2-5 minutes)
Firestore is currently building the indexes in the background.

**Check Status:**
Visit the Firebase Console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tasktrackr-f106e/firestore/indexes

You should see the indexes with status:
- 🟡 **Building** → Wait a few minutes
- 🟢 **Enabled** → Ready to use!

### 2. Test the Filters

Once indexes show "Enabled", test each filter in your app:

- [ ] **All Tasks** - Should work (no index needed)
- [ ] **Pending** - Test filtering by pending status
- [ ] **Checked In** - Test filtering by checked in status
- [ ] **Completed** - Test filtering by completed status
- [ ] **Expired** - Test expired tasks filter

### 3. Verify No Errors

Run the app and check logcat for:
- ✅ No more `FAILED_PRECONDITION` errors
- ✅ Tasks load correctly for each filter
- ✅ Smooth filter transitions

## Troubleshooting

### If Errors Persist

1. **Check Index Status**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
   - Ensure all indexes show "Enabled" (not "Building" or "Error")

2. **Clear App Cache**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Restart App**
   - Stop and restart the app
   - Try filters again

### If Index Build Fails

1. Check Firebase Console for error messages
2. Verify `firestore.indexes.json` syntax is correct
3. Redeploy indexes:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

## Alternative: Auto-Create Indexes

If you prefer, you can also create indexes directly from the error links:

The error messages contain direct links to create indexes:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/tasktrackr-f106e/firestore/indexes?create_composite=...
```

Click these links to auto-create the indexes in Firebase Console.

## Files Modified

- ✅ `firestore.indexes.json` - Added composite indexes
- ✅ `FIRESTORE_INDEXES_GUIDE.md` - Documentation created
- ✅ `FIRESTORE_INDEX_FIX_CHECKLIST.md` - This checklist

## Summary

The filter feature is now complete and properly configured! Once the indexes finish building (check Firebase Console), all filter operations will work smoothly.

**Current Status:** ⏳ Waiting for Firestore to build indexes (2-5 minutes)

**Next Action:** Check Firebase Console and test filters once indexes are enabled
